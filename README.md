# Agrofit Scraping

## Overview

This is a small project where I performed webscraping in the [agrofit website](https://agrofit.agricultura.gov.br/agrofit_cons/principal_agrofit_cons) using the [web-harvest](http://web-harvest.sourceforge.net/) framework. Agrofit is a government website related to the Department of Agriculture, where you can find information about plants diseases, plagues, pesticides and its printed directions for usage.

## Goal

This was coded to run in a java routine (I did it for a local company - they required the use of this specific framework). The main purpose is to generate a xml file with the needed information, which would be stored in their database later. The file [plantas_daninhas_scrap_result.xml](scrap_plantas_daninhas.xml) contains a output example.

## Usage

One can use one of the following options to run this:

    1. The Web-Harvest IDE
    2. Command Line
    3. Java Code
